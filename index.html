    <section id="about">
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>With over a decade of sales experience across industries such as elevator, aviation, fitness, automotive, finance, and software, I've managed pipelines exceeding $25 million and overseen operations for 125 locations. I know what it takes to grow, scale, and stay efficient. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, I grew up in a family business that thrived for 30 years, rooted in loyalty and relationships.</p>
      <p>Iron Pulse exists because I’ve lived through the challenges small and mid-sized businesses face. I’ve sold complex products and scaled service-based operations — and I’m here to help you do the same with better systems, smarter marketing, and sharper follow-up.</p>
